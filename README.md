# Covid-19 Lung Infection Simulator (C19-LIS). 



## Description
There is one (1) Matlab executable file (.m suffix) for the Blue Brain Project's Covid-19 
glucose-dependent lung epithelium infection simulation.

Users must have a relatively recent version of Matlab installed (R2016a or later, and 64 bit). 
To run the simulation simply type the name of the .m file in the Matlab command window,

`>>BlueBrain_C19LIS`

or use the command line in a terminal window if not utilzing the Matlab gui workspace (>matlab BlueBrain_C19LIS).

Use the Matlab workspace editor or an editor of your choice to modify the .m file for figure output,
parameter adjustments, or other desired changes.
